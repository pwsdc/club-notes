  > I hope this email finds you well. My name is .... We had the pleasure of connecting at .... I’m writing to extend an invitation to you and/or your colleagues to speak at Cal’s Software Development Club regarding future internship opportunities at ....
  > 
  > The members of the Software Development Club are some of the most committed students in the Comp Sci and CIS programs at Cal. It’s likely ... will have success recruiting future talent from this pool. We have several members who will be looking for internships by next summer, if not sooner. If you are still seeking interns, I think you will find good candidates here.
  > 
  >  If ... is interested, we are flexible on formats. We could host you in person in the Eberly lab where we meet on Thursdays at 11:00 am. We could also do a virtual meeting – our lab has a good projector and camera for a virtual meeting. If you want to meet with additional qualified students, we can coordinate with Rhonda Gifford in the Career Center and reserve a larger space and send out campus wide announcements to targeted majors of your choosing at Cal and the other PennWest campuses.
